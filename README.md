# Housing-Price-Prediction
This repository contains the octave and python implementation of univariate and multivariate linear regression.

This project is Stanford Machine Learning Course's first assignment.

Originally in octave, this repository contains the implementation of linear regression for 2 features but scalable to multiple features because of vectorised implementation.

Additionally, an IPython notebook has been added for the python implementation of the assignment.
